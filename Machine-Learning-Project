# Machine Learning Project 1: Spam Classification

## Overview

This project involves a **Spam Classification** dataset that consists of labeled SMS messages classified as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). This dataset is commonly used for text classification tasks, particularly for building spam detection models.

### Dataset Description

- **Columns**:
  - `Category`: Contains the labels indicating whether the SMS is "spam" or "ham".
  - `Message`: The actual SMS text that needs to be classified.

### Example Data

| Category | Message |
| -------- | ------- |
| ham      | Go until jurong point, crazy... Available only in Bugis and Great World for a buffet. |
| spam     | Free entry in 2 a weekly competition to win FA Cup final tickets on 21st May 2005. Text FA to 87121 to receive entry question (standard text rate applies). |

### Purpose

The dataset can be used for:
- Training a machine learning model to detect spam messages.
- Evaluating text feature extraction techniques such as TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.
- Experimenting with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
