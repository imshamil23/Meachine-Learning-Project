                            ## Spam Classification Dataset Overview

This dataset consists of labeled SMS messages, which are either classified as "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). It is commonly used for text classification tasks, particularly for building spam detection models. Below is a brief description of the dataset:

- **Columns**:
  - `Category`: This column contains the labels, indicating whether the SMS is "spam" or "ham".
  - `Message`: The actual SMS text that needs to be classified.

### Example Data:

| Category | Message |
| -------- | ------- |
| ham      | Go until jurong point, crazy.. Available only in bugis n great world la e buffet... |
| spam     | Free entry in 2 a wkly comp to win FA Cup final tkts 21st May 2005. Text FA to 87121 to receive entry question(std txt rate)... |

### Purpose:
The dataset can be used for:
- Training a machine learning model to detect spam messages.
- Evaluating text feature extraction techniques such as TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.
- Experimenting with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
